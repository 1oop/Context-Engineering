# PROMPTS: Goal-Oriented Templates for AI Interaction

> "The right prompt is not just a request—it's an architecture for thinking."

## Overview

Welcome to **PROMPTS**, a library of carefully crafted templates designed to help you accomplish your goals through effective agentic system prompts and programs. Unlike traditional prompt collections, these templates are organized around what you're trying to achieve.

This library is based on extensive research into human-AI interactions, designed to bridge the gap between frontier AI capabilities and practical everyday use. Each template embodies principles from context engineering while remaining accessible and immediately useful.

## How to Use This Library

### Find Your Goal

Start by identifying what you're trying to accomplish:

- **Creating something?** → Explore the `creating/` directory
- **Building or making?** → Check out the `building/` directory
- **Thinking or analyzing?** → Visit the `thinking/` directory
- **Improving something?** → Browse the `improving/` directory
- **Solving a problem?** → Look through the `solving/` directory
- **Teaching or explaining?** → See the `teaching/` directory
- **Working with others?** → Explore the `collaborating/` directory
- **Just need something quick?** → Start with `everyday/` templates

### Choose a Template

Once you've found your goal category, select the specific template that matches your needs. Each file contains multiple related templates with clear guidance on when and how to use them.

### Customize and Use

Templates are diverse and include:
- Clear instructions on when to use it
- The template itself with placeholders
- Step-by-step guidance for customization
- Real-world examples showing it in action
- Tips for getting the best results
- Variations for different scenarios

Simply copy the template, replace the placeholders with your specific information, and use it with your preferred AI system.

## Featured Templates

Here are some of our most versatile templates to get you started:

```

## Design Principles

These templates are built on several core principles:

1. **Goal-oriented**: Organized by what you want to accomplish
2. **Human-centered**: Designed from your perspective, not the AI's
3. **Practical**: Ready to use with minimal customization
4. **Versatile**: Adaptable across domains and AI systems
5. **Progressive**: Simple core with optional complexity
6. **Transparent**: Clear about what each part does and why

## Contributing

This library is designed for extension. To contribute:

1. **Add to existing files**: Add new templates to relevant existing files
2. **Create new files**: If you have templates for a new subcategory, create a new file in the appropriate directory
3. **Propose new directories**: If you have templates for an entirely new goal category, propose a new directory

Ensure new templates follow the established format and design principles.

## Origins and Future Direction

The PROMPTS library emerges from the intersection of context engineering research and practical AI application. It represents our ongoing work to bridge theoretical frameworks with everyday utility.

This resource will evolve alongside frontier AI capabilities, incorporating new interaction patterns and template structures as they emerge. We're committed to maintaining a library that remains both theoretically grounded and immediately practical.

## Beyond Templates

These templates are just the beginning. The true power comes from:

1. **Adaptation**: Modifying templates for your specific needs
2. **Combination**: Merging templates for complex tasks
3. **Iteration**: Refining templates based on results
4. **Extension**: Creating your own templates using the principles demonstrated

## Feedback and Evolution

This library is a living resource designed to grow and adapt. Your feedback and contributions help shape its evolution.
