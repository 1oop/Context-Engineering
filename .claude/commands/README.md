## Overview

This directory contains a collection of modular, extensible agentic command harnesses designed for enhancing the capabilities of [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) and other frontier agentic systems, such as [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode), [Amp](https://sourcegraph.com/amp), [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/) or [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli). Each command implements a specialized agent protocol with consistent structure, enabling sophisticated context engineering across various domains.

These harnesses serve as scaffolds for context-driven AI workflows, leveraging the latest research in cognitive tools, neural field theory, symbolic mechanisms, and quantum semantics to create more capable and predictable AI interactions.

/command Q="query" param="value" context=@file.md ...

[context]→[specialized_phase_1]→[specialized_phase_2]→...→[synthesis]→[audit/log]
        ↑___________________feedback/CI___________________|
```

## Command Structure

Each command follows a standardized system prompt format optimized for modularity, auditability, and recursive self-improvement:

```
/command.agent.md
├── [meta]            # Protocol version, runtime, namespaces
├── [instructions]    # Agent rules, invocation, argument mapping
├── [ascii_diagrams]  # File tree, workflow, phase flow
├── [context_schema]  # JSON/YAML: domain-specific fields
├── [workflow]        # YAML: specialized workflow phases
├── [tools]           # YAML: tool registry & control
├── [recursion]       # Python: feedback/revision loop
└── [examples]        # Markdown: sample runs, logs, usage
```

## Available Commands

| Command | Purpose | Usage Example |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| `/alignment` | AI safety/alignment evaluation | `/alignment Q="prompt injection" model="claude-3"` |
| `/cli` | Terminal workflow automation | `/cli "find all .log files and email summary" alias=logscan` |
| `/comms` | Stakeholder communications | `/comms Q="major outage" audience="internal" type="crisis"` |
| `/data` | Data transformation and validation | `/data input="data.csv" op="validate" schema=@schema.json` |
| `/legal` | Legal research and analysis | `/legal Q="contract review" jurisdiction="US" type="SaaS"` |
| `/literature` | Literature review and writing | `/literature Q="PEMF effect on neuroplasticity" type="review" years=3` |
| `/marketing` | Marketing strategy and campaigns | `/marketing goal="lead gen" channel="email" vertical="SaaS"` |
| `/optimize` | Code and process optimization | `/optimize target="foo.py" area="speed" mode="aggressive"` |
| `/test` | Test generation and execution | `/test suite="integration" mutate=true report=summary"` |

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Invocation

Commands follow the slash command pattern with named arguments:

```bash
/command Q="main question" param1="value1" param2="value2"
```

### File References

Include file contents in commands using the `@` prefix:

```bash
/legal Q="contract review" context=@agreement.md
```

### Bash Command Integration

Execute bash commands and include their output using the `!` prefix:

```
/cli "commit changes" context="!git status"
```

### Workflow Phases

Each command implements domain-specific workflow phases that systematically:

1. **Parse context and clarify goals**
2. **Execute specialized domain operations**
3. **Generate synthesis and recommendations**
4. **Maintain audit logs and versioning**

### Feedback Loops

Commands implement recursive improvement cycles via feedback loops:

```python
def agent_cycle(context, state=None, audit_log=None, depth=0, max_depth=4):
    # Phase execution
    for phase in workflow_phases:
        state[phase] = run_phase(phase, context, state)
    
    # Recursive improvement
    if depth < max_depth and needs_revision(state):
        revised_context, reason = query_for_revision(context, state)
        audit_log.append({'revision': phase, 'reason': reason, 'timestamp': get_time()})
        return agent_cycle(revised_context, state, audit_log, depth + 1, max_depth)
    else:
        state['audit_log'] = audit_log
        return state
```

## Integration with Context Engineering

These commands integrate with the broader Context Engineering framework:

```
atoms → molecules → cells → organs → neural systems → neural fields
  │        │         │        │             │              │
single    few-     memory/   multi-    cognitive tools   fields +
prompt    shot     agents    agents    prompt programs   persistence
```

Each command implements this progression, enabling:

1. **Modular Cognitive Processing** - Decomposable cognitive operations
2. **Emergent Symbolic Mechanisms** - Natural symbolic processing capabilities
3. **Context-Dependent Interpretation** - Observer-dependent meaning actualization
4. **Efficient Resource Management** - Optimized cognitive resources
5. **Progressive Complexity** - Scaling from simple to sophisticated behaviors

## Creating Custom Commands

To create your own command harness:

1. **Copy an existing template** from this directory
2. **Modify domain-specific sections** for your use case
3. **Define specialized workflow phases** tailored to your domain
4. **Register appropriate tools** for each phase
5. **Include helpful examples** and audit logging

Follow this naming convention:
- Project-specific commands: `.claude/commands/your-command.md`
- Personal commands: `~/.claude/commands/your-command.md`

## Usage with Claude Code CLI

Commands work seamlessly with the Claude Code CLI following the Anthropic [slash command documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands).

Key features:
- **Namespacing** via subdirectories (e.g., `/domain:command`)
- **Arguments** via the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder
- **Bash integration** using the `!` prefix
- **File references** using the `@` prefix

## Implementation Strategy

These commands follow key principles:

1. **Layered Approach** - Building from foundations to advanced integration
2. **Practical Focus** - Ensuring theory has practical implementation
3. **Modular Design** - Creating composable, recombinant components
4. **Progressive Complexity** - Starting simple, adding sophistication incrementally
5. **Integration Emphasis** - Focusing on component interactions
6. **Self-Improvement** - Building systems that enhance themselves
7. **Transparency** - Maintaining understandability despite complexity
8. **Collaboration** - Designing for effective human-AI partnership
9. **Modal Flexibility** - Supporting unified understanding across modalities

## Contributing

When creating new command harnesses:

1. Follow the established structural patterns
2. Include comprehensive documentation and examples
3. Implement appropriate audit logging and versioning
4. Test across different runtime environments
5. Consider integration with existing commands

## Future Directions

This directory will expand to include:
- Additional domain-specific commands
- Enhanced integration with external tools
- More sophisticated feedback mechanisms
- Improved cross-command coordination
- Advanced field-theoretic implementations
