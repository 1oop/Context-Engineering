## Introduction to Interpretability Protocols

Interpretability protocols transform the "black box" nature of AI interactions into transparent, explainable processes that reveal how and why decisions are made. By establishing explicit frameworks for understanding AI systems, these protocols help you create trustworthy, accountable, and comprehensible AI interactions.

This guide provides ready-to-use interpretability protocols for creating transparent, explainable AI interactions, along with implementation guidance and performance metrics. Each protocol follows our NOCODE principles: Navigate, Orchestrate, Control, Optimize, Deploy, and Evolve.

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Select a protocol** that matches your transparency goal
2. **Copy the protocol template** including the prompt and customize
3. **Provide the complete protocol** to your AI assistant at the beginning of your interaction
4. **Follow the structured process** for creating transparent, explainable outputs
5. **Monitor metrics** to evaluate interpretability effectiveness
6. **Iterate and refine** your protocol for improved transparency

**Socratic Question**: What aspects of AI decision-making do you currently find most opaque or difficult to understand? When would greater transparency most benefit your interactions with AI systems?

### Implementation Guide

1. **Context Definition**:
   - Clearly describe the output to attribute
   - Provide relevant background
   - Note specific attribution questions

2. **Focus Specification**:
   - Define attribution priorities
   - Identify specific elements for analysis
   - Consider scope and boundaries

3. **Input Identification**:
   - List potential influence factors
   - Categorize by type or source
   - Consider both obvious and subtle inputs

4. **Depth Determination**:
   - Choose appropriate attribution detail
   - Define quantification approach
   - Consider example and evidence needs

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Attribution Coverage | Comprehensiveness of factor identification | All significant influences identified |
| Influence Accuracy | Correctness of impact assessment | Verified correlation with outcomes |
| Example Clarity | Effectiveness of illustrative cases | Clear demonstration of factor impacts |
| Actionable Insight | Practical utility of attribution | Ability to adjust inputs for desired outcomes |

## 6. The Counterfactual Exploration Protocol

**When to use this protocol:**
Need to understand how changes to inputs would affect AI outputs? This protocol guides you through exploring alternative scenarios—perfect for testing sensitivities, exploring options, understanding boundaries, or identifying critical factors.

Prompt: I need to explore how different inputs would have affected our AI-powered pricing recommendation system. Our system suggested a 15% price increase for our premium product line, and before implementing this recommendation, I want to understand how sensitive this output is to various input factors. Specifically, I want to know what changes to competitor pricing, market deman
